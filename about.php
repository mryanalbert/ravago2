                <p class="section-body">
                    Ravago Equipment Rentals, Inc. (RERI) is a 100% Filipino owned
                    corporation that was established in 1979. The company started out
                    with earth moving and lifting equipment like bulldozers, loaders,
                    graders, forklifts, truck mounted cranes and crawler type cranes.
                    As the need for higher efficiency and capacity was required, RERI
                    started importing truck-mounted cranes with lattice as well as
                    hydraulic telescopic booms. In its 42 years of operation, RERI is
                    one of the biggest crane rental companies in the Philippines. Also
                    expanded its line of forklifts, man lifts, aerial platforms,
                    excavators, generators and other heavy equipment.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Asian Shipping Corporation, a sister company, has the largest
                    fleet of landing crafts (LCT), tugboats and barges. The close
                    teamwork between the two companies gives RERI easy access in the
                    transport of its rental fleet to and from job-sites all over the
                    7,100 islands of the Philippines.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    With the constant upgrading of equipment and the continuous
                    training of personnel, you can be assured of the best service in
                    the industry.
